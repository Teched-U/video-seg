"""
	Connected Component Labelling algorithm.
	Jack Lawrence-Jones, July 2016

	For blob/connected component detection in binary images. Labels each pixel in a given connected component 
	with the same label.

	2 pass implementation using disjoint-set data structure with Union-Find algorithms to record 
	label equivalences.

	O(n) for image containing n pixels. 

	Usage:
		Python:
			>>> image = Image.open("./binary_image.png")
			>>> bool_image = image_to_2d_bool_array(image)
			>>> result = connected_component_labelling(bool_image, 4)

		Terminal (second parameter is connectivity type):
			$  python ccl.py path/to/image.png 4
